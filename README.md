# CPU-Stress
CPU Stress Testing Code
This Python code is a simple example of how to stress your CPU by utilizing all available CPU cores. It's important to note that running code like this can put a heavy load on your CPU, potentially causing overheating and damage to your hardware. Therefore, it should be used with caution and only for educational or testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Some basic knowledge of Python and multiprocessing.
Usage
Clone or download the code to your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the code is located.

Run the code using Python:

Copy code
```python
python stresser.py
```
The code will start as many processes as there are CPU cores available on your system, making them use as much CPU as possible.

Monitor your system's temperature and performance. If your computer becomes unresponsive or if the temperature increases significantly, it's crucial to stop the code immediately.

Caution
Running this code can lead to overheating, reduced hardware lifespan, and even permanent damage if used irresponsibly.
Always monitor your system's temperature and performance when running this code.
Use this code at your own risk and with a clear understanding of the potential consequences.
Stopping the Code
To stop the code, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the code is running. This will send an interrupt signal to the Python process and terminate it.
